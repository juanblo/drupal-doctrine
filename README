Drupal and Doctrine integration module

This module integrates Doctrine on Drupal 7 CMF. It's a initial version
inspired by doctrine module written by Jonnathan Wage (doctrine lead
developer) for Drupal 5.x. 

Before install
--------------

Download the Doctrine libraries from http://www.doctrine-project.org and
place it in lib/ directory under doctrine module installation directory, 
as follows: 

$ cd drupal_root_installation/sites/default/modules/doctrine 
$ mkdir lib
$ cd lib
$ cp -r path_download_doctrine/Doctrine .

I've tested this module in a clean installation of Drupal 7 and 
works Ok. 


TODO
----

* Fix relations in schema.yml
* Documentation
* Test
* Integration with de devel module (???)
